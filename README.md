# Habberdash

The most best and awesomest open source dashboard framework/system ever.  Srsly!


## The Story

A while back our team purchased some nice big displays and mounted them on a wall near our work spaces.  This was
awesome, because now we could put up all our sweet ass metrics that show how nerdy we are, and also so we can track
development progress and status of our projects.

But when we started to look into the options available for dashboards we were a little less than impressed with what's
available.  Many are fairly expensive, and none had the ability to write the type of widgets that we wanted to.  To top
it off, there wasn't any that looked good either.  Bummer!  So, we decided to write our own kick ass dashboard, and
Habberdash was born.
